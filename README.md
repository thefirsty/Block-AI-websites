# 🧠 Brain Gym - AI Blocker to keep your brain sharp

I used to be sharp.  
Then I started "just checking ChatGPT real quick." 
5 hours later I'd emerge, not smarter - just confused and mildly ashamed.

So I built myself a small tool. A resistance band for the brain.  
Because apparently, thinking is now an extreme sport.

## 💪 What Is This?

A small tool that acts like a personal trainer yelling "NO!"  
at your attempts to open ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or anything else that wants to "help" you think.

It modifies your hosts file and redirects those tempting AI websites back to the void (a.k.a. 127.0.0.1).

You'll try to open ChatGPT.  
You'll fail.  
And then... you might actually think for yourself.

## 📌 What It Blocks

Everything from:

chatgpt.com
openai.com
claude.ai
gemini.google.com
copilot.microsoft.com
...

All blocked inside your `hosts` file, like this:

```hosts

127.0.0.1 chatgpt.com
127.0.0.1 openai.com
127.0.0.1 bard.google.com
127.0.0.1 gemini.google.com
127.0.0.1 copilot.microsoft.com
127.0.0.1 claude.ai
127.0.0.1 perplexity.ai
127.0.0.1 character.ai
...
#ai_blocker_end
```

Heavy. Frictional. Beautiful.
